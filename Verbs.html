                <h2>Verbs</h2>
                <hr>
                <h3>What is a verb?</h3>
                <p>Verbs are the action words in a sentence that describe what the subject is doing. Along with nouns, verbs are the main part of a sentence or phrase, telling a story about what is taking place. In fact, without a verb, full thoughts can’t
                    be properly conveyed, and even the simplest sentences, such as Maria <b class="font-italic">sings</b>, have one. Actually, a verb can be a sentence by itself, with the subject, in most case you, implied, such as, <b class="font-italic">sings</b>                    and
                    <b class="font-italic"> Drive!</b>
                </p>
                <p>When learning the rules of grammar, schoolchildren are often taught that verbs are ‘doing’ words, meaning they signify the part of the sentence which explains the action taking place: He ran away, she eats chocolate cake on Sundays, the
                    horses gallop across the fields. Ran, eats and gallop are the ‘action’ parts of those sentences, thus they are the verbs. However, it can be confusing because not all verbs are easily identifiable as action: I know your name, Jack
                    thought about it, we considered several applications. These are non-action verbs, i.e. those that describe a state of being, emotion, possession, sense or opinion. Other non-action verbs include include love, agree, feel, am, and have.</p>
                <h4>How to Recognize a Verb</h4>
                <p>As you can see from the examples above, one clue to help you recognize a verb is its location compared to the subject. Verbs almost always come after a noun or pronoun. These nouns and pronouns are referred to as the subject. The verb
                    thought comes after the noun Jack, so the action Jack (subject) was taking was thinking (verb).</p>
                <p>Examples:-</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1. Mark <b>eats</b> his dinner quickly.</li>
                    <li>2. We <b>went</b> to the market.</li>
                    <li>3. You <b>write</b> neatly in your notebook.</li>
                    <li>4. They <b>thought</b> about all the prizes in the competition. </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Physical Verbs – Definition and Examples</h4>
                <p>Physical verbs are action verbs. They describe specific physical actions. If you can create a motion with your body or use a tool to complete an action, the word you use to describe it is most likely a physical verb. For example, Joe sat
                    in his chair, the dog breathes quickly after she chases her ball, and should we vote in the election? Even when the action isn’t very active, if the action is done by the body or a tool, consider it a physical verb.</p>
                <h4>Physical Verb Examples</h4>
                <p>The physical verb examples in the following sentences are in bold for easy identification.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Let’s <b>run</b> to the corner and back.</li>
                    <li>I <b>hear</b> the train coming.</li>
                    <li><b>Call</b> me when you’re finished with class.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Mental Verbs – Definition and Examples</h4>
                <p>Mental verbs have meanings that are related to concepts such as discovering, understanding, thinking, or planning. In general, a mental verb refers to a cognitive state.</p>
                <h4>Mental Verb Examples</h4>
                <p>The mental verb examples in the following sentences are in bold for easy identification.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I <b>know</b> the answer.</li>
                    <li>She <b>recognized</b> me from across the room.</li>
                    <li>Do you <b>believe</b> everything people tell you?</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>States of Being Verbs – Definition and Examples</h4>
                <p>Also known as linking verbs, state of being verbs describe conditions or situations that exist. State of being verbs are inactive since no action is being performed. These verbs, forms of to <b>be</b>, such as am, is, are, are usually
                    complemented by adjectives.</p>
                <h4>States of Being Verb Examples</h4>
                <p>The state of being verbs in the following sentences are in bold for easy identification.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I <b>am</b> a student.</li>
                    <li>We <b>are</b> circus performers.</li>
                    <li>Please <b>is</b> quiet.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Types of Verbs</h4>
                <p>There are many types of verbs. In addition to the main categories of physical verbs, mental verbs, and state of being verbs, there are several other types of verbs. In fact, there are more than ten different types of verbs that are grouped
                    together by function.</p>

                                <p>Transitive verbs are action verbs that always express doable activities that relate or affect someone or something else. These other things are generally direct objects, nouns or pronouns that are affected by the verb,
                                    though some verbs can also take an indirect object, such as show, take, and make. In a sentence with a transitive verb, someone or something receives the action of the verb.</p>
                                <p>Transitive verb examples:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Love</li>
                                    <li>Respect</li>
                                    <li>Tolerate</li>
                                    <li>Believe</li>
                                    <li>Maintain</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>The transitive verb examples in the following sentences are in bold for easy identification.</p>
                                <p>Gary <b>ate</b> the cookies.</p>
                                <p>The transitive verb is ate, Gary is the subject, because it is Gary who is doing the eating, and the cookies are the direct object, because it is the cookies that are being eaten. Other examples:</p>
                                <P>He <b>kicked</b> John.</P>
                                <p>John <b>punches</b> him.</p>
                                <p>They <b>sold</b> the tickets.</p>
                                <p>Examples of verbs used with both direct and indirect objects:</p>
                                <p>They <b>sell</b> him the tickets.</p>
                                <p>In this sentence, the tickets are the direct object while him is the indirect object.</p>
                                <p>Mary <b>baked</b> her mother a pie.</p>
                                <p>In this sentence, a pie is the direct object while her mother is the indirect object.</p>

                                <p>Intransitive verbs are action verbs that always express doable activities. They are different from transitive verbs because there is no direct object following an intransitive verb.</p>
                                <p>Intransitive verb examples:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Walk</li>
                                    <li>Laugh</li>
                                    <li>Cough</li>
                                    <li>Play</li>
                                    <li>Run</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>The intransitive verb examples in the following sentences are in bold for easy identification.</p>
                                <p>We travelled to London.</p>
                                <p>The intransitive verb is travelled, the subject is we, because we are doing the travelling, but London is not a direct object because London is not receiving the action of the verb. Other examples:</p>
                                <p>I <b>sneeze</b> in the morning.</p>
                                <p>He <b>arrived</b> with moments to spare.</p>
                                <p>Kathryn <b>sat</b> away from the others.</p>
                                <p>John <b>eats</b> before leaving for school.</p>
                                <p>The last example shows that the verb eats can be both transitive and intransitive depending on whether there is a direct object or not. If the sentence read: John eats the cookies before leaving for school, eats would be
                                    transitive as there is a direct object – the cookies.</p>
                                <p>By the way, some verbs can be both transitive and intransitive. These verbs include: start, leave, change, live, stop.</p>

                                <p>Auxiliary verbs are also known as helping verbs and are used together with a main verb to show the verb’s tense or to form a question or negative. Common examples of auxiliary verbs include have, might, will. These auxiliary

                                <p>I <b>go</b> home after football practice.</p>
                                <p>In this case, there is no definite time frame for the action. The sentence suggests that going home after football practice is just something the subject I generally does. Other examples:</p>
                                <p>I <b>may</b> dance with you later.</p>
                                <p>Jenny <b>has</b> spoken her final words.</p>

                                <p>Modal verbs are auxiliary verbs that are used to express abilities, possibilities, permissions, and obligations.</p>
                                <p>Modal verb examples:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Can</li>

                                </ul>
                                <p>The modal verb examples in the following sentences are in bold for easy identification.</p>
                                <p>He <b>can</b> shoot a three-point shot easily.</p>
                                <p>The auxiliary verb can is expressing an ability, suggesting that shooting a three-point shot is a skill the subject possesses.</p>
                                <p>Please note that in the case of should and must in the examples below, the modal verbs are expressing obligations, whereas would and may are expressing possibilities.</p>
                                <p>I <b>should</b> go home.</p>
                                <p>You <b>must</b> not delay.</p>

                                <p>Phrasal verbs aren’t single words; instead, they are combinations of words that are used together to take on a different meaning to that of the original verb. There are many examples of phrasal verbs, some of which have
                                    colloquial meanings, such as make up, hand in, bring up, point out, look forward to. Each time the verb takes the extra word(s) it takes on a new meaning. For example, make without the up expresses that something is
                                    being created, whereas with make up, the suggestion is that there are some lies or a fantastical element to the story and make out can mean either to grasp or see something difficult, or to kiss passionately.</p>
                                <p>Phrasal verb examples:</p>

                                <p>Irregular verbs are those that don’t take on the regular spelling patterns of past simple and past participle verbs. Unfortunately, there are hundreds of irregular verbs in the English language. But don’t worry, while many
                                    are used often, the majority are not in common usage – or if they are, you will use them so often you will learn them quickly. Some of the most common irregular verbs include: say, make, go, take, come, know and see.</p>
                                <p>Irregular verb examples:</p>
                                <ul>
